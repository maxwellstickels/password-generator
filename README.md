## Overview

This is a completed version of a Web site provided by UC San Diego's Coding Bootcamp. The original site had essentially the same layout, but was not yet set up for generating passwords. This finished version allows users to randomly generate secure passwords between 8 and 128 characters in length, which can be set to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. On the user's end, this is simply done by clicking the 'Generate Password' button and answering the prompts that appear on screen. In addition, when generating another password the user is given the option to keep their previous settings or change them.

## Programs Used
This website was designed with HTML 5 and CSS 3.0, and refactored in Visual Studio Code 1.54.3.
